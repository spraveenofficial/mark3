          Hey folks, welcome back to another article, Today we are here with
          some interesting topic related to Web Development. <br />
          <br />
          Obviously, it's none other than axios, the most powerful tool in web
          developers community.
          <br />
          <br />
          I will try to explain this by providing easy to understand examples
          and simplified concepts. Let's jump to the main topic of this article.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Axios?</h2>
        <p>
          Axios, is a javascript library used to make HTTP requests (Restful or
          GraphQL API) from node.js or XMLHttpRequest from the browser. Axios
          accomplies the same task as the fetch API provide by the many browser.
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
        <p>
          In order to use Axios you first need to have Node.js installed in your
          local machine / computer. In case if you didn't have installed yet
          please click on this <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">link</a>. This
          link will take you to the official Node.js website. <br />
          <br />
          Next, we must install axios package in project. To get this done, just
          run the following command in your terminal.
        </p>
        <p class="codeline">npm install axios</p>
        <p>In case, if you use yarn, then follow this command:</p>
        <p class="codeline">yarn add axios</p>
        <h2>Using Axios</h2>
        <p>
          The main reason is to use Axios instead of fetch API is because it
          provides a very clean and precise syntax. Nevertheless, it’s important
          to acknowledge that Axios is not always an ideal solution, and there
          are tons of better options are there for making HTTP requests.
        </p>
        <h3>Code using Axios</h3>
        <p>
          Yeah, now we are are good to go with Axios. We are going to write our
          first line of code below. Follow the code below: <br />
          <br />
          Firstly we need to import the Axios package in our project (index.js).
        </p>
        <p class="codeline">const axios = require('axios');</p>
        <p>
          Now, we have imported the Axios package successfully. We are going to
          hit an dummy api to get your all confusing rid out of your mind.
        </p>
        <p class="codeline">
          const getRequest = () =>{ <br />
          <span>axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.com') <br /></span>
          <span>.then(response => console.log(response.data)) <br /></span>
          <span>.catch(error => console.log(error)); <br /></span>

          } <br />
          <br />

          getRequest();
        </p>
        <p>
          In the above example, I am making GET request to the dummy api to
          obtain a object / list. To use Axios library we call the axios
          function and then we call any of the methods provided by the Axios
          library which represent the different HTTP verbs. You need to learn
          about HTTP requests type. Since Axios works with Promises the code on
          line 3 in the given above example will return a Promise.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          And that’s all in this article! You now know how to get started with
          Axios, and how it can be much simpler than XML or fetch requests.
          Thanks for reading! <br />
          <br />
          Hopefully this blog provided a better understanding in how to use
          Axios GET requests for fetching data and convinced you that it’s a best & better
          alternative to the fetch api.
