          Hey Folks, have you wondered what Git is, what is works for and how to
          get started with? <br /><br />

          Well, as we all developers already knows that GIT is very popular tool
          for developers around the globe. If you don't know what what GIT
          exactly is, then don't worry. This article will try to clear all such
          doubts that comes in every begineer mind. Let't jump to main topic.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <h4>
          <li>Internet & Computer Basics</li>
          <li>Terminal Basics - clear, cd , mkdir, rm</li>
        </h4>
        <p>That’s pretty much. You are ready to go :)</p>
        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Let's know this from Git's documentation: <br /></p>
        <p class="word-light">
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
          designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
          speed and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full form of GIT is Global Information Tracker. It is basically
          designed for programmers to work together It is basically designed for
          programmers to work together on the same source code at the same time.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, imagine you are working in an company / organisation with 100+
          people and all the developers have a copy of the project on their
          local system of the computer. Now, if a second developer who is also
          your friend, let's call him Rohit, introdues a new changes in database
          schemas and tells you about it because he is your friend only, the
          project with new commit will only be stored in Rohit's system (local
          machine) and you as the lead developer will have to copy Rohit's local
          machine through some resources. Now this situation becomes worse. Here
          git plays very important role. When each and every employee is use
          GIT, and if Rohit makes any changes to codebase, you along with other
          developers will find that out instantly. What change that some made,
          each and every thing gets noticed by using any version control system.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started with Git</h2>
        <p>
          Before understanding and using Git commands, I am assuming that git is
          already installed and configured on your machine correctly. <br />
          <br />
          If not, Please follow the steps below to install and configure Git.
        </p>

          >
          to install Git on your System.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you’ve installed Git on your system, let’s fire up the
          Terminal/Command Prompt and get ready to go with Git. Please run the
          following command to check if Git was installed properly or not. If
          this commands not works for you please try to add Environment Variable

        <p>
          It's very important to set up some of the basics credentials like
          email and name before using git, by this you will gets to know which
          changes was made by whom. <br />
